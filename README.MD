# Todo App with ReactJS

## Description

This is a little project to improve my skills in ReactJs

## Learning Objectives

-   Be able to create a new React application
-   Be able to "think in React"
-   Be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
-   Be able to organize your app in components

## My Mission

build a small todo application that lives in browser, and saves todos even after restarting the browser.

## ðŸŒ± Must-have's

-   Read this documentation on [the basics](0.The-Basics/README.md)
-   Create a React application and run it locally on your browser (hint-hint: [start here](1.Getting-Started/README.md))
-   Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
-   Build a todo app with React.js (Check out this useful [instructions](2.Extra-Documentation) )
-   Save your todos, even after starting the browser again
-   Deploy the project on a live server

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have (doable)

-   Refactor parts you aren't happy with.
-   Rebuild from scratch without any tutorial to improve your understanding ([instructions](2.Extra-Documentation) will be of a big help here!).
-   Improve on your project so that it's not only a learning repository, but also a showcase project when interviewing:
-   Add styling
-   Improve responsiveness
-   Check for little, smooth effects
-   Think UX: what extra features can make your todo app better?

## ðŸŒ³ Nice-to-have (hard)

Done with all the above? Don't worry! We have some more you can do:

-   Install a React package of a calendar and implement it in a new component into your App.
-   Install and use React-router-dom as a router between components. _(Hint: Think about a structure like: router -> show component)_

-   See if someone else needs help.
-   Have a live edit option for existing todos (when you click on the text of a todo, the app allows you to edit it in place).
-   Make a version with another JS framework like VueJS or Svelte.
